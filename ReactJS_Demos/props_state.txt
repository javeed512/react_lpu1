props:

props property can be used inside function component as function parameter.
props  property can also be used inside class component by using this keyword.

props is immutable in nature (props values cannot be modified)

function  App(props){

	<h1>{props.name}</h1>

}


<App name="javeed" />


---------------------------------------

state:

state property is used in class component (class component also known as stateful component)

state property is used to store/ handle data in components because state is mutable in naturel

state values can be modified.

state in class component can be declare or initialize in 2 ways.
1. inside constructor
2. inside class by using setState()


class Student extends Component{

constructor(props)
{
super(props);


this.state={

	id: 101
	name: "king"
	fee: this.props.fee
	

}

}

}


<Student  fee={5000} />








state can be used for function components also with the help of hooks (pre-defined methods)

useState() 





Note: we can initialize value of props to the state , but reverse is not possible
